The code imports necessary dependencies such as node-fetch, fetch-cookie, path, and fs modules. These modules are commonly used in web scraping and file operations.

The Crawler class is defined, and its constructor initializes various properties such as queue, headers, and allowedPatterns. The queue property will store URLs to be crawled, headers contains the headers to be sent with each request, and allowedPatterns defines an array of regular expressions that determine which URLs are allowed to be crawled.

The seedGenerator method populates the initial URL into the queue property. In this case, it adds a single URL to begin the crawling process.

The makeRequest method uses the fetch function to make an HTTP request to a given requestURL with provided requestOptions. It returns an object containing the request information, response, content, and content type.

The fetchURL method is responsible for fetching a URL and discovering links within the content. It uses the makeRequest method internally and appends discovered links to the queue. It returns an array containing the response object.

The discoverLinks method parses the content and extracts URLs using a regular expression. It checks if the discovered URLs match the allowed patterns and adds them to the queue for further crawling.

The isAllowedURL method checks if a given URL matches any of the allowed patterns defined in allowedPatterns. It returns true if the URL is allowed, false otherwise.

The crawlerRunner method is the main function that orchestrates the crawling process. It starts by calling seedGenerator to initialize the queue. It then enters a loop, processing URLs from the queue until it is empty. For each URL, it calls the fetchURL method, processes the response, and performs additional actions depending on the content type. If the content type is HTML, it saves the content to a file and extracts case URLs for further crawling.

The extractCaseURLs method uses a regular expression to extract case URLs from the provided content. It returns an array of extracted URLs.

The extractCaseData method extracts case data such as the case number and year from the provided content using regular expressions. It returns an object containing the extracted data.

Finally, an instance of the Crawler class is created, and the crawlerRunner method is called to start the crawling process.
